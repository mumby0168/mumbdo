# Mumbdo
A simple to do list application for me to use.

This aims to show an onion architecture application. Following modern practices and principles such as DI, SOLID and Unit Testing.

Refere to [Timebox](https://github.com/mumby0168/timebox/blob/main/README.md) to see how the project will be laid out.

This has a full CI/CD Pipeline and makes use of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Key Vault as well as an App Service.
